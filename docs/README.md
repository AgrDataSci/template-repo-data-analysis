# docs

This is an optional folder. If you plan to write R notebooks, a report, a scientific paper or any document that will summarize/describe the work done in this workflow, use this folder.

Hint 1. In a .rmd doc, files in the folder output can be called using "../output/filename.extension"

Hint 2. Use the R package `rticles` to get templates for scientific papers
