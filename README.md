# Template analysis workflow

This is a template for R projects for data analysis. For repositories with other goals please look at other templates (if any). Create your new repository using this template, then clone the repo and change the name of the existing R-project file .Rproj or create a new R-project (https://bookdown.org/daniel_dauber_io/r4np_book/starting-your-r-projects.html) 

Suggestions/comments on this template or for new templates are welcome!
