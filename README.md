## Template for project-oriented and FAIR data analysis workflows
> Kauê de Sousa, Marie-Angélique Laporte

Here we introduce a reusable, project-oriented data analysis template designed to align with the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable). The template offers a structured and scalable approach for managing scientific data and code, particularly suited for collaborative and open science environments. It integrates good practices from R-based workflows, GitHub–Zenodo integration, and metadata standards including DataCite and CFF.

---

## Objectives

The template aims to:

- Improve consistency and reproducibility across research projects.
- Ensure research outputs are FAIR and ready for long-term archiving.
- Provide a ready-to-use metadata structure for data and code publication.
- Support automated workflows and interoperability with platforms like Zenodo, GitHub, and institutional repositories.

---

## Repository structure

The project follows a project-oriented layout inspired by best practices in the R community.

## Best practices incorporated

- **Project-oriented** structure.
- **FAIR-compliant metadata** with Zenodo and DataCite standards.
- **Automation** via R scripts for JSON conversion and validation.
- **Citation support** with `CITATION.cff` file.
- **Clear separation** of raw data, outputs, scripts, and documentation.
- **GitHub–Zenodo integration** for DOI minting.

---

## Metadata management

The `metadata/` folder contains:

- `metadata.xlsx`: Main spreadsheet with sheets for general metadata, authors, funders, dates, and communities.
- `metadata.json`: DataCite-compliant metadata for institutional or repository submission.
- `CITATION.cff`: Used by GitHub and Zenodo to generate citation metadata (it must be placed on the main root).
- `README.md`: Guide to using the metadata tools.

---

## How to use this template

1. **Clone or fork the repository** and open it in RStudio.
2. **Complete `metadata.xlsx`** using the provided structure.
3. **Add your data**
4. **Run your analysis**
5. **Run the R scripts** from the `script/` folder to:
   - Validate metadata 
   - Convert to JSON
6. **Publish to Zenodo**:
   - Enable the GitHub repo in your [Zenodo GitHub settings](https://zenodo.org/account/settings/github/).
   - Create a GitHub release. Zenodo will use the `CITATION.cff` to generate the DOI metadata.

---

## Reusability and extensions

This template is suitable for:
- Research projects requiring data publication.
- Collaborative projects across CGIAR and university partners.
- Students and researchers new to reproducible data workflows.

The structure is extensible and can support:
- Additional metadata schemas and controled vocabularies (e.g., Dublin Core, DCAT)
- Workflow automation using GitHub Actions or R scripts
- Integration with institutional data catalogs
