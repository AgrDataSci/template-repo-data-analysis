# scripts

All scripts used in the analysis must be here. 

Hint 1. Put your scripts in numeric order, then everybody knows where to start. e.g.

- 00-functions.R
- 01-data-cleaning-bean-yield.R
- 02-analysis-yield-estimation.R
- 03-produce-maps.R

Hint 2. Create helper scripts.

These scripts are not necessarily linked to the data analysis workflow. But can be used to automate processes like generating parseable metadata.
