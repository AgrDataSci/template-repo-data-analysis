# data

All data used for the analysis must be here. Try your best to keep all the files that you need for the analysis in this folder. If you have big files, please document and provide a persistent link to access the data.

Hint 1. Avoid names with backspace and use "-" or "_" to separate names. eg. this "bean-data-arusha.csv" instead of this "Bean data Arusha.csv"

Hint 2. Create a sub-folder "data/raw" do add data in the raw format and that need to be heavily cleaned or organized before the analysis
