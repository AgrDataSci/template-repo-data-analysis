  Managing research data in accordance with the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) is essential for ensuring transparency, reproducibility, and effective scientific collaboration [@Wilkinson2016]. Reproducibility, the ability to repeat an analysis, and replicability, the ability to repeat an experiment under similar conditions [@Stevens2017], are foundational to trustworthy and collaborative science [@Powers2019; @Munafo2017]. These practices enable researchers to revisit analyses after extended periods and allow peers to verify results or generate new insights from existing data. In this context, we present a structured and reusable repository template specifically designed to support FAIR data workflows and promote both reproducibility and replicability across research projects.

# Statement of need

Data-driven research faces several challenges, including inadequate data documentation, inconsistent structure, and poor reproducibility [@Wilkinson2016; @Munafo2017]. Researchers often struggle with these aspects, lacking practical examples or accessible tools. To address these issues, we created a project-oriented, easy-to-use data template. It streamlines metadata management, facilitates reproducibility, and ensures alignment with FAIR principles.

# Repository structure

The template repository includes clear, intuitive folder structures and essential resources.

```text
template-repo-data-analysis/
|-- data/                                       # Anonimized raw and cleaned datasets
|-- docs/                                       # Reports or additional documentation
|-- metadata/                                   # Metadata files and templates
|    |-- project-metadata.xlsx                  # Project metadata
|    |-- project-metadata.json                  # Project metadata for DataCite

# Key features

-   FAIR-aligned metadata: Comprehensive metadata files (.xlsx, .json) aligned with Zenodo (<https://zenodo.org>) and DataCite [@RobinsonGarcia2017] schemas.
-   Automated workflows: R scripts [@CRAN] to validate and convert metadata, ensuring consistent quality.
-   Citation integration: A CITATION.cff file for automatic citation generation.
-   Reproducibility: Scripts and clear instructions ensure any researcher can reproduce results.
-   Open and collaborative: Open licensing (CC BY 4.0, <https://creativecommons.org>) promotes collaboration, reuse, and attribution.

# Implementation and usage

Researchers can easily adopt this repository by:

1.  Cloning the repository from GitHub (<https://github.com/AgrDataSci/template-repo-data-analysis>).
2.  Adding their data and performing their analysis.
3.  Filling in the provided project-metadata.xlsx template.
4.  Running provided R scripts for validation and metadata generation.
5.  Publishing via integrated platforms like Zenodo for long-term archiving and DOI assignment.

# Conclusion

Adopting structured, FAIR-aligned workflows can significantly enhance reproducibility, collaboration, and transparency in research. This template provides a practical starting point, promoting best practices from the outset of research projects.
